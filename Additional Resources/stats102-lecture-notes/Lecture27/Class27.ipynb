As Mr Ng explains, looking at the training and validation (he calls this one development) errors can help you understand how your model is performing relative to *bias* and *variance*. Specifically, your training error gives you a good indication of your model's ability to fit the data or bias.  And then, the difference between these errors give you an indication of the model's ability to generalize or variance.  Finally, please note his point about Bayes error (or noise floor).  This is a particularly important consideration if Bayesian error is of the same order of magnitude as training and validation errors."
